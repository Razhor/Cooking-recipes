1) Roasted strawberry and cream pie

Ingredients:

435g store-bought sweet shortcrust pastry rolled to a thickness of 3mm
750g strawberries, halved if large
1 vanilla bean (split, seeds scraped) or 2-3 teaspoons of vanilla extract
2 tablespoons (tbs) of maple syrup
1 thyme sprig (plus extra to decorate)
500g mascarpone cheese
1½ cups thickened cream
1/3 cup icing sugar
1 teaspoon of vanilla bean paste
Method

Preheat oven to 200°C. Line a 22cm × 5cm-deep pie dish with the shortcrust pastry and trim away the excess. Prick holes in the pastry base to stop it from rising or use baking beads. Cook for 20 minutes or until golden. Leave to cool completely.
Toss together strawberries, vanilla extract, maple syrup and thyme on a baking tray lined with baking paper, and roast for 15 minutes or until soft. Cool to room temperature.
Whisk mascarpone, cream, icing sugar and vanilla bean paste in a bowl until thick.
Spread into the cooled pie crust and top with roasted strawberries and their syrup.
